# Task Board AppA task management board to track tasks in different stages: Started, In Progress, and Completed. This app uses drag-and-drop functionality to allow users to organize their tasks visually.## Setup Instructions### 1. Clone the repositoryFirst, clone this repository to your local machine:bashCopy codegit clone https://github.com/your-username/task-board-app.git
cd task-board-app
### 2. Install dependenciesMake sure you have Node.js installed. If you don't have it, download and install the latest version of Node.js.Once Node.js is installed, run the following command to install the required dependencies:bashCopy codenpm install
### 3. Start the development serverTo start the development server and see the app in action, run:bashCopy codenpm start
This will start the app at http://localhost:3000. You can open this URL in your browser to see the application in action.### 4. Build for productionTo create an optimized production build of the app, use:bashCopy codenpm run build
This will generate a build folder that contains the optimized production version of the app. You can deploy this to any static file server or hosting service.## Technology Choices &amp; Rationale### 1. ReactWe chose React as the main library to build the app due to its simplicity, flexibility, and wide adoption in the JavaScript ecosystem. React's component-based architecture allows us to easily create reusable components, and its virtual DOM provides efficient rendering performance.### 2. React Beautiful DnDReact Beautiful DnD was chosen to implement the drag-and-drop functionality of the task board. This library offers an easy-to-use, customizable solution for building interactive drag-and-drop interfaces, allowing users to move tasks between different columns seamlessly.### 3. LocalStorageThe app uses LocalStorage to persist task data on the client-side. This choice was made for simplicity and because the app does not need a full backend server. LocalStorage enables data to persist across sessions in the same browser, making the app experience more user-friendly.### 4. Tailwind CSSTailwind CSS is used for styling the app. Tailwind provides a utility-first approach to CSS, making it easy to quickly build responsive and clean layouts. It reduces the need for writing custom CSS while maintaining flexibility in design.## Known Limitations/Trade-Offs### 1. No Authentication/AuthorizationThe app does not include any authentication or user management features. All task data is stored locally on the user's browser. If a user clears their browser data or uses a different device, the data will be lost.### 2. Limited Data PersistenceWhile LocalStorage is used to persist tasks, it has limitations:Storage Capacity: LocalStorage can only hold a limited amount of data (about 5MB).Single Device/Browser: Data is not shared across devices or browsers. If a user logs in from a different device or clears their browser cache, task data will be lost.### 3. No Server-Side StorageThe app does not connect to any back-end or cloud service for storing data. Therefore, any task changes will only persist on the current device.### 4. Drag-and-Drop PerformanceWhile React Beautiful DnD offers a smooth drag-and-drop experience, in cases where there are a large number of tasks (e.g., hundreds or thousands), the performance might degrade. For larger-scale applications, more efficient drag-and-drop solutions might be needed.## Future Improvements### 1. Authentication &amp; User AccountsImplement authentication (e.g., with Firebase, JWT) so users can log in and access their task boards from any device.### 2. Server-Side StorageIntegrate a back-end (e.g., Node.js with MongoDB) to store tasks on the server, ensuring tasks persist across devices, and enabling multi-device access.### 3. Collaboration FeaturesAdd real-time collaboration features, allowing multiple users to work on the same task board simultaneously (using WebSockets or Firebase Realtime Database).### 4. Task Editing and Priority ManagementAllow users to edit task details (title, description) and add priority levels to tasks. This could include features like color coding, due dates, and categorization.### 5. Better Error HandlingImprove error handling, particularly for cases like LocalStorage failures, invalid data formats, and drag-and-drop errors.### 6. Improved UI/UXEnhance the visual design with more polished interactions (e.g., animations, transitions) and improve the mobile responsiveness for smaller screens.### 7. Search and Filtering EnhancementsExpand the search functionality to filter by task due dates, tags, or priority. Implement sorting by different criteria, such as alphabetical order or due date.### 8. NotificationsAdd notifications for when tasks are moved or updated, or when deadlines are approaching.## LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.
